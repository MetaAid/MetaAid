                        Flooding is the result of a brief overflow of water onto typically dry ground. Floods can occur when strong rains fall, ocean waves crash on the shore, snow melts quickly, or dams or levees fail. In many parts of the world, floods are a common natural disaster. Floods can happen in a matter of minutes or over a lengthy period of time, lasting days, weeks, or even months. Floods may wreak havoc on communities, causing death and damage to personal property as well as important public health infrastructure. Because flash floods combine the destructive power of a flood with extraordinary speed, they are the most dangerous type of flood. When severe rainfall exceeds the ground's ability to absorb it, flash floods occur. They can happen within minutes of the causative rainfall, limiting the time available to warn and protect the public.

Even if you've never seen flooding near your home, you could be at risk. Make a flood plan and ensure that everyone in your household is aware of what to do in the event of floods. A waterproof plastic container or a heavy-duty water-resistant bag should be used to store an emergency kit. After a flood, you may be without power, water, and other necessary services for several days. Purchasing or renewing a flood insurance coverage can go a long way toward covering the costs of the damage.

While floodwater can take time to reach you, flash flooding hits swiftly and can catch you off guard. If a flood threatens your home or property, you should move to a safer location as soon as possible. It is extremely perilous to leave at the last minute because your planned route may be obstructed by fast flowing water. If you're trapped in a building, get to the uppermost floor. Only go up on the roof if it's absolutely essential, and once there, call for aid. To avoid being trapped by rising floodwater, do not ascend into a closed attic.
